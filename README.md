# TODO_List
Here is my TodoList in Javascript, the only way to store the tasks to do is to do it manually in "script / data.txt" because we cannot to my knowledge modify a file in javascript and we cannot implement a database of SQL data without Node.js.
Excuse me for this style sheet, I ran out of time because I had a lot of work for school.
